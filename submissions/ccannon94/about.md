# Chris Cannon

I am a senior computer engineering student at NCAT and a SuperUser with the Aggie Makerspace. I am a software lead for the [Aggies'
Autonomous Auto](http://a3.ncat.edu) project, and a TA in the CompSci department.

Outside of school, my hobbies include TaeKwon-Do and competitive USPSA pistol shooting. I also enjoy camping and hiking.

I am leading this training because I am passionate about the difference that engineers and other dedicated professionals can make in the
world, and I beleive that GitHub provides a platform to enhance our efforts, if we harness it properly. Feel free to @mention me for
help with Git and GitHub, java development, and object-oriented design.
