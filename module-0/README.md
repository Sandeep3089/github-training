# Getting Started with Git and GitHub
## Module 0

### Introduction

Before we get started in the Aggie Makerspace course on source control, there are
several things you will need to do to prepare your computer to complete this course.
The purpose of this module is to have all necessary software for this course installed and configured,
and to have a GitHub
student account!

### Course Content

This module can be experience in one of two ways:
  1. YouTube video available here

### Course Transcript

#### Installing Git

The most important tool we will need for this course is git. Git is a command line utility that
can be downloaded for every platform [here](www.git-scm.com). Download the installer for your
operating system, and install the git tool. For Windows, the default options are all fine.

Once you have installed git, you will access it from the _terminal_ on Linux and MacOS, and
from the Git Bash application on Windows.

#### Configuring Git

You must configure a few settings for git before you can use it. Once again, on a MacOS or
Linux machine, launch the _terminal_ to access git. On Windows machines, launch the Git
Bash application. You should run the following commands to configure git:

`git config --global user.name "[USERS FIRST AND LAST NAME]"`

`git config --global user.email "[USERS EMAIL ADDRESS]"`

Generally, in git and GitHub documentation, anything surrounded by brackets [ ] is a placeholder
for the users own information. You should remove the brackets when you add your information. For
example, for the first command I would run `git config --global user.name "Chris Cannon"`.

#### Installing Atom

Atom is a cross platform, open source, "hackable" text editor built by GitHub and deployed using
GitHub's Electron technology. Atom is not necessarily required for this course, but you will need
a text editor. If you do not already have a favorite text editor, Atom can be downloaded from
[Atom's website](https://atom.io/).
