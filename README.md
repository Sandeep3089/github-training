# Welcome to the Aggie Makerspace GitHub Training

This repository is dedicated to providing a _thorough_ introduction to all of the power of version control
and project management through [git](www.git-scm.com) and [GitHub](www.github.com).

This repository is broken into modules, each covering a specific skill set. As you complete each module, you
will learn new tools and methodologies that can make your projects better organized and more collaborative. You
should start with Module 0, Module 1, and Module 2, as these give you the tools that you need to understand and
work effectively using git on GitHub. The remaining modules can be completed as you find need for them, as each
dives deeper into a specific topic with GitHub.
