# Welcome to the Aggie Makerspace GitHub Training

This repository is dedicated to providing a _thorough_ introduction to all of the power of version control
and project management through [git](www.git-scm.com) and [GitHub](www.github.com).

This repository is broken into modules, each covering a specific skill set. As you complete each module, you
will learn new tools and methodologies that can make your projects better organized and more collaborative.
