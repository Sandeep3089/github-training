# Using Git with GitHub
## Module 2

### Introduction

GitHub is only as powerful as our ability to harness git! Remember, git is the underlying
technology that _actually_ tracks our changes, saves our commits, and stores our branches.
GitHub, on the other hand, is an incredibly powerful web interface and cloud-hosting
platform that allows us to store our git repositories remotely and collaborate with a
community of over _3.5 million_ developers worldwide with additional tools and views.

In this module, there are two ways to complete it. You can either complete it using
the [GitHub Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com) or the [terminal/gitbash](https://git-scm.com).
It is recommended that those without command line experience _start_ with the GitHub
Desktop version. Experienced developers or those looking for a challenge are encouraged
to try working with git on the command line.
